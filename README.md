# Room8
Room8 is a web application written in jQuery with a Node backend that allows roommates to track their rent and utilities, calculate the cost of bills per roommate, and stay on top of their payments. Household, roommate, and bill information is stored in a SQL database so that users can come back and easily access their information, making the bill calculation process simple, easy, and quick.
